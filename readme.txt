Instructions for running the color picking script:

Open up a tab in your browser (ctrl+t).
Right click in the window and select inspect.
This will bring up the developer tools (if you're on safari, you'll have to implement these separately)
Select the console tab (it might be pre-selected) and paste the javascript from 3colors.js into the console.
Hit return.
The function will output 3 colors. If you hate the combination or want to work on a second piece, run the function again by typing pickColors().
